# Introduction
<span style="
font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
font-weight: 700;
letter-spacing: 1px;">
Qwetht</span> is a randomly generated adventure game inspired by classic text-based Adventure games like [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure), webcomics such as [Problem Sleuth](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/newindex.php?viewmap=4) by [MS Paint Adventures](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/newindex.php) and tabletop games such as [Munchkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)). The Game allows a player to pick one of three classes:

| <p style="text-align: center;">The Knight</p> | <p style="text-align: center;">The Thief</p> | <p style="text-align: center;">The Merchant</p> |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| ![Knight](assets/images/jobs/knight.webp) | ![Thief](assets/images/jobs/thief.webp) | ![Merchant](assets/images/jobs/merchant.webp) |

Once the player chooses their class, they will then have a random character generated for them, in addition to an adventure, where they will be take on 10 random encounters in order to complete the game.
<br>
Much like the games it was inspired by, <span style="
font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

letter-spacing: 1px;">
Qwetht</span> is very much designed to be that of a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game, where incorrect decisions or bad luck result in game over, and there is heavy emphasis on starting over fresh each time the game is played.

## This Project was created as the second milestone project for the Diploma in Software Development
