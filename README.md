# Introduction
<span style="
font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
font-weight: 700;
letter-spacing: 1px;">
Qwetht</span> is a randomly generated adventure game inspired by classic text-based Adventure games like [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure), webcomics such as [Problem Sleuth](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/newindex.php?viewmap=4) by [MS Paint Adventures](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/newindex.php) and tabletop games such as [Munchkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_(card_game)). The Game allows a player to pick one of three classes:

| <p style="text-align: center;">The Knight</p> | <p style="text-align: center;">The Thief</p> | <p style="text-align: center;">The Merchant</p> |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| ![Knight](assets/images/jobs/knight.webp) | ![Thief](assets/images/jobs/thief.webp) | ![Merchant](assets/images/jobs/merchant.webp) |

Once the player chooses their class, they will then have a random character generated for them, in addition to an adventure, where they will be take on 10 random encounters in order to complete the game.
<br>
Much like the games it was inspired by, <span style="

font-weight: 700;
letter-spacing: 1px;">
Qwetht</span> is very much designed to be that of a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game, where incorrect decisions or bad luck result in game over, and there is heavy emphasis on starting over fresh each time the game is played.

## This project is the second of the five projects to be created for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (Common Curriculum).

Project purpose: Presentation of interactive data

The aim of this project is to:
 - Build an interactive front-end website
 - The site in question should respond to user's actions, allowing users to interact with data
 - alter the way the site displays information to achieve a preferred user goal
 - The site should make use of HTML, CSS and Javascript to achieve the above aims

# User Experience (UX)

## <b>Strategy Plane</b>

## <span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Stories</span>

### <b>First-time Players</b>
Play-testers were interviewed before playing the game to establish user stories:

1. <em>"As a first-time player, i want to be able to understand the game mechanics with little study. The game UI needs to be intuitive."</em>
2. <em>"As a first-time player, i want there to be a help or menu section that explains the finer intricacies of the game, with little-to-no redirection from the game."</em>
3. <em>"As a first-time player, i want to have the element of choice when starting a game."</em>
4. <em>"As a first time player, i want the game interface to be clear and consistent at each step of the core gameplay loop."</em>
5. <em>"As a first-time player, i want to be able to track my progress during a playthrough."</em>

### <b>Returning Players</b>
After Playtesting the game, players were interviewed to establish their user stories as users who had played the game previously:

1. <em>"As a returning player, I want to be able to pick up where i left off."</em>
2. <em>"As a returning player, I want to be able to see a record of my past completions."</em>
