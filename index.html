                <li><b>QWETHT</b> encounters are determined by random dice rolls behind the scenes (like that guy in the
                    Wizard of Oz!)</li>
                <li>In <b>QWETHT</b> the encounters roll aginst you! (like D&D, but in reverse, you are the goblin now!)
                </li>
                <li>The <b>Strength</b> stat determines how good you are at <b>strength stuff</b> (jumping, fighting,
                    bein strong)</li>
                <li>The <b>Cunning</b> stat determines how much <b>smarts you got</b>, (how to trick people, or be
                    savvy, or read books dead good)</li>
                <li>The <b>Agility</b> stat determines how good you are at <b>running away</b>. (wimp!)</li>

                <li>Between <b>0% - 40% is easy.</b> Encounters can't roll higher than <b>4</b> (suckers)</li>
                <li>Between <b>50% - 70% is Lemon & herb.</b> Encounters can't roll higher than <b>6</b> (like 6
                    6-year-olds in
                    a trenchcoat)</li>
                <li>Between <b>80% - 100% is Dance Dance Revolution.</b> Encounters can roll up to <b>9</b> (They don't
                    wash
                    their hands before dinner!)</li>

                Every Qwetht is different. Encounters are random, you are random, the reason for being on your qwetht is
                random.<br>
                Qwethts can be pretty unforgiving, You can take action or run away from an encounter, but death can loom
                around the corner
                of any choice you make. Take care in your choices and good luck!</h2>
